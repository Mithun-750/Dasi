# Dasi UI System

Dasi features a modern UI system with multiple components:

## Main UI Components

- **Popup UI** ([src/ui/popup/ui.py](mdc:src/ui/popup/ui.py)): The main borderless interface that appears near the cursor
- **Settings Window** ([src/ui/settings_window.py](mdc:src/ui/settings_window.py)): Configuration interface
- **System Tray** (in [src/main.py](mdc:src/main.py)): Provides quick access to settings and app control

## UI Modes

### Chat Mode
- Interactive conversation with the LLM
- History and context are maintained within the session
- Supports multi-turn conversations

### Compose Mode
- Direct content generation mode
- Generated content can be inserted at cursor position
- Designed for quick content creation tasks

## UI Styling

The UI uses a modern, borderless design that:
- Appears near the cursor position
- Uses the dark theme by default (applied in [src/ui/assets](mdc:src/ui/assets))
- Implements responsive design with Qt widgets

## Key UI Interactions

1. Global hotkey activation (default: Ctrl+Alt+Shift+I)
2. Type query or select mode
3. Receive and interact with AI responses
4. Insert content or continue conversation
