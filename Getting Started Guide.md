## Getting Started

### First Launch
When you first run Dasi, if no models are set, the settings window will automatically appear:

1. Go to the "API Keys" tab and enter your API keys
   - **Fun Fact**: You can use the API key from Google AI Studio to access state-of-the-art models like Gemini 2.5 Flash for free
   - If you don't see a provider listed, you can still add it as a custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint

2. Navigate to the "Models" tab 
   - Here you'll find all the models from providers you've added API keys for
   - This list is dynamic as it's fetched through the respective /models endpoint

3. Start Dasi using the button in the bottom left corner of the settings window

4. Close the settings window - Dasi will continue running in the background
   - You'll see a Dasi icon in your system tray
   - Through this icon, you can open settings or stop Dasi

5. Trigger Dasi with the hotkey `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+I` (customizable through settings)
   - A popup will appear near your cursor
   - Here you can send queries to your selected LLMs

### System Tray
The system tray icon provides quick access to:
- Open Settings
- Stop Dasi
- Trigger Dasi (popup will appear in the center of your screen)

## Basic Usage

### Quick Start

2. Type your query in the input box
3. Press Enter to submit
4. View the AI's response in the chat window
5. Continue the conversation or close the window

### Selecting Text

## Operation Modes

Dasi offers two primary modes of operation:

3. After receiving the response, you'll see two additional options:
   - **Use**: Automatically pastes the response where your cursor was last positioned
   - **Export**: Saves the response to a file
4. Look for the pencil icon in the bottom right corner - this allows you to edit the response before using or exporting it

## Prompt Chunks
